To use find symmetries with the symmtries module
(symmetries_module.py), you need to compile the pybind PyBliss
extension first. To do so, change into pybliss-0.73 and type "Make".

External usage with find_symmetries.py:
./find_symmetries.py ../../benchmarks/simple-drive/domain.pddl ../../benchmarks/simple-drive/p01.pddl [--only-object-symmetries] [--blis-time-limit] [--write-dot-graph]

Usage from within the translator:
./translate.py ../../benchmarks/simple-drive/domain.pddl ../../benchmarks/simple-drive/p01.pddl --only-find-symmetries [--only-object-symmetries] [--blis-time-limit] [--write-dot-graph]
Or with fast-downward.py:
./fast-downward.py --translate benchmarks/simple-drive/domain.pddl benchmarks/simple-drive/p01.pddl --translate-options --only-find-symmetries [--only-object-symmetries] [--blis-time-limit] [--write-dot-graph]
